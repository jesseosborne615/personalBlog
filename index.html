            <p>Oh, wild west days of the pandemic, how I miss you sometimes. In the summer of 2021 not a lot of things were certain. The world was still in the grip of the pandemic and I had just recently moved from my home in Georgia to Florida. Would the United States have another recession? Would the world ever get back to normal? When could I go out without wearing a face mask? Will I end up on the news as the next Florida Man? Through all these uncertainties, one thing always held true<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">: Florida is hot. One night I could stand the heat no more and decided to go to 711 to get a drink. On my way in, I noticed a man in scrubs and a man in a hospital gown get out of a car together and go inside. So. Many. Questions. Perhaps Gown Man was terminally ill and on his last day of living wanted nothing more than to go to 711 one last time, and Scrub Man, going against every code in the book, happily obliged Gown Man because the years of treatments and ups and downs and laughs and tears together made them closer than brothers. Maybe Gown Man had OVERCOME a potentially deadly disease and Scrub Man took him out for roller dogs to celebrate? Maybe Gown Man and Scrub Man had fallen in love and their first stop on their way to Paris to start a new life was to get road trip snacks? I may never know the true story of Gown Man and Scrub Man, but I will always have my memories of them that night at 711 during the wild west days of COVID-19.</span></p>

            <p>Alone in my room, I keep hearing my teacher Jim's voice excitedly yelling "fingers on keys!" I am now one week removed from graduating UCF's very intense full stack web development bootcamp. The structure that has defined my life for the last six months<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> is gone. I no longer have class three nights a week, I no longer have assignments due every Monday, I no longer have a final project to lose sleep over. I am alone in my room and having a 'what now' feeling. What do I do now? There's only one choice, really, fingers on keys!</span></p>
